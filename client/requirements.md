## Packages
qrcode.react | Rendering QR codes for WhatsApp pairing

## Notes
The QR code string returned by the API is a raw string that needs to be rendered as a QR code image.
Polling for QR status should happen every 3 seconds on the /qr page.
Dark mode is the default and only mode for this "cultivation" aesthetic.
