Add a Sect System to the bot with these rules:

**Creation**
- Command: `!createsect [SectName] [SectTag]`
- Only 5 sects can ever exist across the entire bot's lifetime. Once 5 are created, no more can be made — ever.
- A user must have at least **10,000 XP** to create a sect. Creating a sect costs **1,000 XP** deducted from the creator immediately.
- The user who creates a sect becomes its Sect Leader.
- The SectTag is added as a prefix to the member's display name automatically (e.g. `[MOON] Username`).
- Sect name and tag can never be changed after creation.
- If the user has less than 10,000 XP: `You need at least 10,000 XP to found a sect.`

**Joining**
- Command: `!joinsect [SectName]`
- Max 20 members per sect including the leader.
- A user can only be in one sect. After leaving or being kicked they can join again freely.

**XP Boost**
- Normal users earn 5 XP per message (existing behavior).
- Sect members earn 10 XP per message.

**Donations**
- Command: `!donate [amount]`
- Members can donate up to 100 XP per day from their personal XP to their sect's treasury.
- This is the only way the sect treasury grows.

**Sect Leaderboard**
- Command: `!sectranking`
- Ranks all 5 sects by their treasury XP, highest to lowest.
- Display: Rank, SectTag, SectName, Leader, Members count, Treasury XP.

**Sect Profile Picture**
- Command: `!setsectpfp` — Leader sends this command with an image attached.
- Only the Sect Leader can set it. Stored and displayed above the `!mysect` output.
- Non-leaders get: `Only the Sect Leader can set the sect profile picture.`

**Sect Info**
- Command: `!mysect`
- Display the sect profile picture above the text if one has been set.
- Display the sect info in this exact format:
```
――――――――――――――――――――――
        [SECTAG] SECTNAME        
――――――――――――――――――――――
  Leader: [LeaderName]
  Members: [current]/20

  2. [Member2]
  3. [Member3]
  ...
――――――――――――――――――――――
  TREASURY: [amount] XP

```
- If not in a sect reply with: `You are not in any sect. Use !joinsect [SectName] to join one.`

**Leave**
- Command: `!sectleave`
- Removes the user from their sect and strips their sect tag. They can join another sect freely after.
- If the leader tries to leave: `You are the Sect Leader. Kick all members first.`

**Kick**
- Command: `!kickmember [username]`
- Sect Leader only. Removes the member from the sect and strips their tag. Kicked user can join any sect again.
- Non-leaders get: `Only the Sect Leader can kick members.`

**Punish**
- Command: `!punish [username]`
- Sect Leader only. Mutes the target from gaining any XP from messages for 24 hours.
- Bot announces: `[Username] has been punished by [Leader]. They will gain no XP for 24 hours.`
- If already punished: `[Username] is already serving a punishment.`
- Non-leaders get: `Only the Sect Leader can punish members.`
