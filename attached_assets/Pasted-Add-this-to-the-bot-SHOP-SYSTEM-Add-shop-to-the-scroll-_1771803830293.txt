!buy [item name]

When a user types !buy followed by an item name check their current XP against the item price. Also check if the user already has that item in their inventory.

If they already own that item and have not used it yet send:

❌ You already own a [ITEM NAME]. Use it before buying another.

If they have enough XP and do not already own the item:
Deduct the XP cost from their total XP. Add the item to their inventory. Then send:

✅ Purchase Successful

You bought a [ITEM NAME].
It has been added to your inventory.

Remaining XP: [REMAINING XP]

Type !inventory to see your items.

If they do not have enough XP send:

⚠️ Insufficient XP

You do not have enough XP to purchase [ITEM NAME].

[ITEM NAME] — [ITEM PRICE] XP
Your XP — [USER CURRENT XP] XP

Earn more XP by chatting and come back.

If the item name they typed does not exist in the shop send:

❌ That item does not exist in the shop. Type !shop to see available items.

If the user tries to buy a Living Core send:

❌ The Living Core is not for sale. It cannot be bought.

If the user types !buy with no item name send:

Type !buy followed by an item name. Example: !buy Cursed Coin

SHOP RULES:

The Living Core is never available in the shop under any circumstance and cannot be added to it.
A user cannot buy an item if their XP would go below 0.
A user cannot buy an item they already own until they have used it and it has been consumed from their inventory.
XP is deducted immediately on purchase.
Items go directly into the user's inventory after purchase.
The shop is always available and does not rotate.
Item names are not case sensitive so !buy blood rune and !buy Blood Rune both work.
