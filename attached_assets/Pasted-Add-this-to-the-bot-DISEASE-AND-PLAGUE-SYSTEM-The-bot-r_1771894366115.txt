Add this to the bot:

DISEASE AND PLAGUE SYSTEM:

The bot randomly triggers a disease outbreak for a 
specific race at random intervals with no admin input. 
When an outbreak begins the bot announces it in the 
group. The disease lasts a random duration between 
1 day and 7 days. When it ends the bot announces it.

Users protected by a Shadow Veil from the Cursed Bone 
are completely immune to all diseases and cannot 
contract or spread them.

Constellation race cannot contract any disease or plague.

---

HOW INFECTION WORKS:

When a disease is active for a race any user of that 
race who uses !leaderboard or !profile automatically 
contracts the disease. Once infected the user loses 
5hp every 5 minutes automatically until cured or 
the outbreak ends.

Private message when infected:
You have been infected.
The sickness spreads through your veins.
You are losing 100 XP every 30 minutes.
Visit the shop to find a cure.

When a user buys and uses a cure matching their 
active disease they are instantly cured. The 100 XP 
drain stops immediately. The cure is consumed after use.

Bot message when cured:
The sickness retreats. Your strength returns.

💊 You have been cured of [DISEASE NAME].
Your XP drain has stopped.
