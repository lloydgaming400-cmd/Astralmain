a dying tree starved of water and light.

CURE SYSTEM:

All cures are available in the shop at all times 
regardless of whether an outbreak is active. A user 
can only use a cure that matches their current race 
disease. If they try to use a cure for a different 
race the bot sends: This cure was not made for you.

Add all cures to the !shop display under a separate 
section labeled:

💊 Cures
Grey Rot Cure — 500 XP
Hellfire Suppressant — 600 XP
Feral Antidote — 600 XP
Grace Restoration Vial — 700 XP
Scale Restoration Salve — 800 XP
Rootwither Remedy — 700 XP

When a user buys and uses a cure matching their 
active disease they are instantly cured. The 100 XP 
drain stops immediately. The cure is consumed after use.

Bot message when cured:
The sickness retreats. Your strength returns.

💊 You have been cured of [DISEASE NAME].
Your XP drain has stopped.
Current XP: [CURRENT XP]

Bot message if they try to use a cure with no disease:
You are not infected. Save it for when you need it.

Bot message if they use the wrong race cure:
This cure was not made for you.
It has no effect.
