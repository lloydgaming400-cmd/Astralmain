Cursed Bone:
Rarity: Uncommon

What it does: When used the Cursed Bone attracts shadows 
to the user. These shadows form a protective aura around 
them that makes them immune to all race diseases and 
plagues permanently until a race change item is used 
on them or until the disease and plague system 
specifically overrides it. Consumed after use.

GENERAL RULES FOR ALL FOUND ITEMS:

The bot never reveals thresholds or drop chances to anyone.
If asked the bot says: Some things reveal themselves in time.
Spam under 3 characters does not count toward any threshold.
Repeated identical messages only count once per minute.
Bot commands do not count toward any threshold.
Daily thresholds reset at midnight every day.
Overall thresholds never reset unless stated.
Items go straight to inventory when found.
A user can only hold one of each item at a time.
If a user already holds that item the drop is skipped 
and the threshold resets.
