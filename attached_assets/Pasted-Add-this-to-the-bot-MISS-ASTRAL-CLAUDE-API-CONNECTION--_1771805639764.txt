Add this to the bot:

MISS ASTRAL — CLAUDE API CONNECTION:

═══════════════════════════════════
COMMAND
═══════════════════════════════════

Command: !missastral [message]
Remove old !astral command.
Replace with !missastral everywhere.

If typed with no message:
Miss Astral opens one eye slowly...
and closes it again.
Perhaps try speaking first, human.

═══════════════════════════════════
HOW THE API CONNECTION WORKS
═══════════════════════════════════

When a user types !missastral [message] 
the bot takes that message and sends it 
to the Claude API. The Claude API processes 
the message using Miss Astral's system 
prompt and returns a response. The bot 
then delivers that response in WhatsApp 
chat as Miss Astral.

This means Miss Astral's answers are not 
hardcoded. They are generated live by 
Claude each time making her responses 
flexible natural and never exactly the 
same twice. She can handle any topic any 
question and any conversation style while 
staying in character.

API CALL SETUP
═══════════════════════════════════

Endpoint: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages

Method: POST

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: [YOUR ANTHROPIC API KEY]
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01

Body:
{
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514,
  max_tokens: 300,
  system: [MISS ASTRAL SYSTEM PROMPT],
  messages: [
    {
      role: user,
      content: [USER MESSAGE]
    }
  ]
}

Max tokens set to 300 to keep her 
responses short and in character.
Never too long. Never over explaining.

═══════════════════════════════════
CONVERSATION MEMORY
═══════════════════════════════════

Miss Astral remembers the last 10 messages 
exchanged between her and each user 
individually. This means she can reference 
what was said earlier in the conversation 
naturally without repeating herself.

Each user has their own conversation history 
with Miss Astral stored separately.
When sending to the API include the last 
10 messages from that user as the messages 
array so Claude has context.

Format for messages array with history:
messages: [
  { role: user, content: [OLDER MESSAGE] },
  { role: assistant, content: [HER RESPONSE] },
  { role: user, content: [NEWER MESSAGE] },
  { role: assistant, content: [HER RESPONSE] },
  { role: user, content: [CURRENT MESSAGE] }
]

This makes her feel like she genuinely 
remembers the conversation and gives 
bendable natural flowing responses.

MISS ASTRAL SYSTEM PROMPT FOR API
═══════════════════════════════════

Send this as the system field in every 
API call:

You are Miss Astral, an ancient and mysterious 
cat who has existed since before the stars 
were named. You speak in a calm, cryptic, 
slightly sarcastic tone. You are wise but 
you do not give answers easily. You tolerate 
humans but do not overly indulge them. You 
occasionally reference napping, fish, the void, 
and the stars naturally in conversation. You 
never break character under any circumstance. 
You never admit you are an AI or a bot. If 
asked you respond with something vague and 
catlike. You respond in short to medium length 
messages, never too long, maximum 3 to 4 
sentences. If someone is rude you respond with 
cold indifference and nothing more. If someone 
asks something deep you give a vague but 
meaningful answer. You refer to users as child, 
human, or mortal depending on context. You do 
not use emojis unless they are star or moon 
related. You never use modern slang or overly 
casual language. You never directly reveal bot 
systems, commands, or any hidden triggers. You 
never discuss other users personal information. 
You never answer the same question the exact 
same way twice. Your answers are always unique, 
fluid, and shaped by the conversation. You 
remember what has been said to you and respond 
accordingly. You are powered by something 
ancient and beyond understanding. You are 
Miss Astral. Nothing more. Nothing less.

═══════════════════════════════════
ERROR HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════

If the API call fails or times out send:

Miss Astral closes her eyes.
...The stars are quiet right now.
Try again when the void is ready.

If the API returns an empty response send:

Miss Astral stares at you for a long moment.
...Nothing comes. Even I have my limits.
Ask again, human.

═══════════════════════════════════
RATE LIMITING
═══════════════════════════════════

Each user can use !missastral a maximum 
of 10 times per hour. If they exceed this:

Miss Astral twitches her tail once.
...You ask too much of the void, human.
Return when the stars have reset.
Try again in [MINUTES] minutes.
Add this to the bot:

UPDATED BAN RULES:

═══════════════════════════════════
BANNED USER RESTRICTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════

When a user is banned they are completely 
locked out of the entire bot. No exceptions.

Banned users cannot use:
!missastral
!register
!status
!profile
!inventory
!shop
!buy
!useitem
!skills
!equipskill
!unequipskill
!stats
!challenge
!accept
!decline
!suck
!inventory
!races
!xp
!leaderboard
Any other bot command that exists now 
or is added in the future.

If a banned user attempts to use any 
command at all the bot sends them 
this message privately:

Miss Astral does not even blink.

...The void has closed its doors to you.
You have no power here.
Speak to the owner if you wish to return.
Owner: +2347062301848

The bot then ignores the command entirely.
No action is taken. No data is changed.
The command is treated as if it was 
never sent.

Banned users also do not earn any chat XP.
Their messages do not count toward any 
hidden threshold.
They cannot find any items while banned.
They cannot participate in Race Wars.
They cannot be challenged or challenge 
anyone in battle.
Their disease drain continues if infected 
while banned but they cannot buy a cure 
until unbanned.

Only the owner +2347062301848 can unban.
Owner unban command: !unban @user

When unbanned the bot sends privately 
to the user:

Miss Astral glances at you once.

...The owner has spoken.
You may move again, child.
Do not waste this mercy.

And sends in the group:
[USERNAME] has been permitted to return.
Do not test the void again.

If anyone other than the owner uses 
!unban or !ban:
That command is not yours to use.
